## Introduction to E2E Tests

#### What is an E2E Test?

E2E test tests the application from the end userâ€™s perspective.
It is important to know that an E2E test does not test frontend or backend.
It tests the application as a whole (all components successfully integrated together).

#### How do we test the UI?

We're using an automated framework [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).
It is able to simulate real user behaviour e.g. clicks, typing text etc.

## Running E2E Tests

#### How to run the tests?

1. Build the app locally

    The testing framework needs to access the page, therefore we need to run the development server first.
    See [this section](./FRONTEND.md#installation-and-development).

1. Launching the test runner

    Use this command:

    ```
    npm run test:e2e
    ```

    It opens GUI cypress runner where you can select the test suite and run it by clicking on it.
