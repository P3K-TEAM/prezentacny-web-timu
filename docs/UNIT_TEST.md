# UNIT Tests

This documentation covers everything about developing and running the UNIT tests.

## Introduction to Unit Tests

#### What is an Unit Test?
Unit tests allow you to test individual units of code in isolation. 
The purpose of unit testing is to provide developers with confidence in their code.
By writing thorough, meaningful tests, you achieve the confidence that as new features are built 
or your code is refactored your application will remain functional and stable.

#### How do we test ?

We're using an automated framework [Mocha](https://mochajs.org)
with [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com) - BDD / TDD assertion library for node and the browser


## Running UNIT Tests

#### How to run the tests?


1. Launch the test runner by using this command:
