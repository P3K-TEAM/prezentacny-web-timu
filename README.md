E2E test tests the application from the end userâ€™s perspective. It tests the application whether are all components successfully integrated together.
For more information see the [this guide](docs/E2E_TESTS.md).


### Unit Tests

Unit tests allow you to test individual units of code in isolation. The purpose of unit testing is to provide developers with confidence in their code. By writing thorough, meaningful tests, you achieve the confidence that as new features are built or your code is refactored your application will remain functional and stable.
You can learn about unit tests [here](docs/UNIT_TESTS.md).
